# Description
Ollie is a project managment tool built using React, Firebase, and Google Cloud Functions. This web app service implemented features such as basic CRUD operations, and automatic email notifications and story creation. Additionally, the project utilizes Continous Delivery and Continous Integration. This project is still a work in progress.

This was one of my first ever usages of React, which I now use regularly in building my web applications!

# Testing
The web app is deployed on [here](https://qagcodes.github.io/Ollie/#/) for demo purposes. You can use username "test@test.com" and password "test123" to check out the current progress!

# Note
**This project has been discontinued**
